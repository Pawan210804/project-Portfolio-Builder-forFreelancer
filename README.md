## **üõ†Ô∏è Installation Guide**

To get PortfolioCraft up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### **Prerequisites**

* **Web Server**: Apache or Nginx (commonly provided by XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP, or LAMP stack).  
* **PHP**: Version 7.4 or higher.  
* **MySQL**: Database server.

### **1\. Clone the Repository**

git clone https://github.com/your-username/PortfolioCraft.git  
cd PortfolioCraft

### **2\. Database Setup**

1. Create a Database:  
   Open your MySQL client (e.g., phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or command line) and create a new database. Let's name it signup\_db (as specified in login.php and signup.php).  
   CREATE DATABASE signup\_db;  
   USE signup\_db;

2. Create the users Table:  
   Execute the following SQL query to create the users table:  
   CREATE TABLE users (  
       id INT AUTO\_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  
       username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,  
       email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,  
       password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,  
       created\_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP  
   );

3. Update Database Credentials (if necessary):  
   Open login.php and signup.php. Verify and update the database connection details if they differ from your local setup:  
   // login.php and signup.php  
   $host \= 'localhost';          // Your database host  
   $db   \= 'signup\_db';         // Your actual database name (should be 'signup\_db')  
   $user \= 'root';               // Your database username  
   $pass \= '';                   // Your database password (e.g., '' for XAMPP default)

### **3\. Place Files on Your Web Server**

Move all the files from the cloned repository into your web server's document root (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP, www for WAMP).

Example path for XAMPP:  
C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\PortfolioCraft\\

### **4\. Access the Application**

Open your web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost/PortfolioCraft/signup.php

or

http://localhost/PortfolioCraft/login.php

You should see the signup or login page.

2. **Log In**: Access your dashboard via login.php.

   * The template1\_minimal.html, template2\_creative.html, and template3\_professional.html files provide different starting points for your portfolio. template3\_professional.html includes an interactive editing experience using Alpine.js.
